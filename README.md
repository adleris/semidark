**semidark** -- Play around with MacOS Mojave Dark Mode

Pre-Mojave, there was a dark menu bar and dock option that was a "semidark" 
Mode. In Mojave, there's only the option for light or dark modes.

This lets you still choose the semidark option as well as revert back to normal dark mode.

Mac needs to be in Dark Mode and must be restarted when switching

**Usage**

`./semidark [-mode] (-ui)`

    -s  * dark menu bar and dock
    -f  * full dark mode (mojave standard)
    -f2 * full dark mode alt. approach if not working

    -ui * set notification center / spotlight to dark as well
